                                * GPS accuracy averages x meters, meaning we should take this inaccuracy into account when comparing people&rsquo;s movement patterns<br />
                                * This is why we have split the festival area into Rectangles<br />
                                * (d3 of user hitting rectangle areas with polygon hit)<br />
                                * Each time a user enters a specific rectangle, a rectangle hit is registered<br />
                                * Every hour, the id of the touched rectangle is recorded, leading to a vector that looks like this:<br />
                                * [63202115, 63202116, 63202117, 63202118, &#8230;]<br />
                                * or, graphically, like this: (grid with touched grids)<br />
                                * GPS update frequency is set to 15 minutes, but hardly any user does send an update that often (b/c of network overload, dead batteries, app killing, &#8230;)<br />
